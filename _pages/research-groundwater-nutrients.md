## Overview
Researching the interaction between **groundwater discharge** and the **coastal ocean** is crucial because it transports key nutrients—particularly **nitrate, phosphate, and ammonia**—that help sustain phytoplankton and fisheries. In this study, we focused on **understudied links between anthropogenic activity and the outflow of nutrients in groundwater**, with implications for coastal ecosystem productivity and resilience.

## My role
- Conducted **ship-based ocean sampling** and **shore/nearshore groundwater sampling**.  
- Applied **radioisotope tracers** as effective indicators of groundwater inputs.  
- Built hands-on experience with **groundwater, radioisotope, and marine chemistry** techniques.  
- Organized field notes, metadata, and initial QA for downstream analyses.

## Tech & methods
- **Field:** ocean and groundwater sampling to characterize nutrient composition.  
- **Analytical:** nutrient measurements (NO₃⁻, PO₄³⁻, NH₄⁺) and **radioisotope tracers** for groundwater contributions.  
- **Synthesis:** relate nutrient signatures to potential **anthropogenic influences** affecting outflow.

## Results
- The work targeted **how increased human activity may alter nutrient export** from groundwater to coastal waters, with consequences for **primary production**.  
- A key takeaway is the **need for advances in real-time monitoring** to better resolve dynamic groundwater–ocean interactions under diverse anthropogenic pressures.
