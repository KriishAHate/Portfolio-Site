I am **Kriish Hate**, an **M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering** with a concentration in **Mechatronics** at **Northeastern University**, where I am a researcher in the **Environmental Sensors Group** supervised by [Professor Amy Mueller](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/mueller-amy/).

My research interests span **mechanical engineering**, **mechatronics**, **embedded systems**, **biogeochemistry** and **marine chemistry**. Broadly, I am interested in developing **novel instrumentation** with a **systems engineering** approach—building sensors and technologies that help us better **map, monitor, and understand** complex environments.

I completed my undergraduate degree in **Environmental Science** at **Rowan University**, and prior to that, I studied **Physics** in **India**. These diverse academic experiences shaped my **interdisciplinary** outlook and sparked my drive to merge **engineering** with **environmental science**.

Beyond academics, I am passionate about working with **machines**—**cars**, **motorcycles**, and everyday projects. I love **repairing**, **rebuilding**, and **restoring** mechanical systems, as well as **designing** and **building** my own furniture. Whether in the lab, workshop, or garage, I find joy in **creating**, **problem-solving**, and bringing ideas to life. I also enjoy writing about these projects—check out my [blog](https://kriishahate.github.io/Kriish-Blog/)!
