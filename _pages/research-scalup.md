## Overview
I worked on a **small, customizable autonomous logging platform** for underwater deployments. The effort focused on robust data acquisition and power-aware operation while running **experiments to test the efficacy of antifouling treatments**.

> Low-cost platforms such as these provide wider accessibility to underserved populations and help promote **citizen science**.

## My role
- Embedded-system bring-up and **systems integration** across sensors, storage, and power.
- Firmware design with an emphasis on **software reliability** (watchdogs, logging safeguards, sanity checks).
- Planning and execution of **antifouling efficacy experiments** and data analysis.

## Tech & methods
- **Comms / protocols:** I²C, UART  
- **Microcontrollers:** Teensy family  
- **Languages / tools:** C/C++, **Embedded C**, Arduino **Sketch**, Python, MATLAB  
- Additional hardware and bench tooling across a variety of platforms.

## Results / links
- Antifouling test campaign completed; logging stack validated in water.
