 Welcome to my research page!

I am broadly interested in *Biogeochemistry, Marine chemistry, Instrumentation & Engineering*.

**I wish to build on my existing research in the following areas:**

I am particularly interested in exploring how novel technologies can aid a better
understanding of current land–sea interactions and environments that can result in
improved data, visualisation, and outcomes, ultimately supporting better-informed
decision-making.

My research interest converges at the intersection of marine chemistry,
biogeochemistry, and engineering, aiming to apply engineering principles to
designing novel instrumentation for enhanced ecosystem mapping.

1. Developing **low(er) cost sensor platforms** and observation technology.  
2. Developing technologies such as **autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)** to
   explore and understand coastal environments *in situ* and in real-time.

### (SCALUP) Small Customizable Autonomous Logging Underwater Platform (SCALUP) & Testing the efficacy of BIOINSPIRED antifouling treatments

At WHOI in Dr. Matthew Long’s **MACHINE LAB** I worked on an autonomous logging platform.  
The skills I gained during this project were working on embedded systems, I gained expertise in systems integration and ensuring software reliability. I developed proficiency in communication protocols like I2C and UART, and expanded my technical skill set across C/C++, Embedded C, Python, Sketch, MATLAB, and Teensy microcontrollers, along with a variety of other hardware platforms. Additionally, I conducted experiments testing the efficacy of antifouling treatments.  
*Low cost platforms such as these provide a wider accessibility to underserved populations and help in promoting citizen science.*

### Assessing salt marsh health using multispectral imagery from drones

In a project by the NJDEP (New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection) aimed at developing a novel method using multispectral imagery from drones to assess the health of New Jersey’s 200,000 acres of tidal wetlands, I contributed by learning to sample pore water chemistry as the ground-truthing component for the drone imagery used in mapping and assessing wetland health.  
*The development of this method helped create a more rapid assessment technique and a cost-effective, labor-efficient way to map wetlands.*

### Denitrification Process Rates Along a Gradient of Salt Marsh Health

Based on this project, I developed an independent proposal focused on investigating the influence of ditching on denitrification rates, to correlate with the drone imagery and see if we are able to maintain this ecosystem service.

### How does nutrient composition in groundwater flow affect coastal ocean primary production?

Researching the interaction between groundwater discharge and the ocean is crucial due to its role in nutrient transport, particularly nitrates, phosphates, and ammonia, for which radioisotopes can be effective tracers. This study aimed to understand the understudied aspects of how increased anthropogenic activity affects the outflow of nutrients in groundwater, which is crucial for supporting coastal ecosystems by maintaining phytoplankton production and fish populations. During this project, I gained practical experience at sea and developed skills in ship-based ocean, groundwater, and radioisotope sampling techniques and knowledge in marine chemistry.  
*However, the current methodologies necessitate advancements in real-time monitoring technologies to enhance understanding of these dynamic interactions in the context of diverse anthropogenic influences.*
