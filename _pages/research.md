 Welcome to my research page!

I am broadly interested in *Biogeochemistry, Marine chemistry, Instrumentation & Engineering*.

**I wish to build on my existing research in the following areas:**

I am particularly interested in exploring how novel technologies can aid a better
understanding of current landâ€“sea interactions and environments that can result in
improved data, visualisation, and outcomes, ultimately supporting better-informed
decision-making.

My research interest converges at the intersection of marine chemistry,
biogeochemistry, and engineering, aiming to apply engineering principles to
designing novel instrumentation for enhanced ecosystem mapping.

1. Developing **low(er) cost sensor platforms** and observation technology.  
2. Developing technologies such as **autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)** to
   explore and understand coastal environments *in situ* and in real-time.
