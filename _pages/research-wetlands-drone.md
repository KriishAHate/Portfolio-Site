## Overview
As part of an **NJDEP (New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection)** effort to develop a **novel method for assessing the health of New Jersey’s ~200,000 acres of tidal wetlands**, we paired **multispectral drone imagery** with **on-site pore-water chemistry**.  
This integrated approach supports **faster, cost-effective, and labor-efficient** wetland mapping and condition assessment.

## My role
- Learned and performed **pore-water sampling** as the **ground-truthing** component for drone flights.  
- Coordinated field collection with the flight team to align sampling locations/times with imagery coverage.  
- Assisted with basic QA/labeling and data handoff for downstream analysis and mapping.

## Tech & methods
- **Remote sensing:** Multispectral drone imagery (vegetation/health indices from spectral bands).  
- **Ground truth:** In-situ **pore-water chemistry** sampling at targeted wetland locations.  
- **Workflow:** Field planning → flights → pore-water sampling → data collation for mapping/assessment.  

## Results
- The resulting workflow **reduced assessment time** while providing a **cost-effective** way to map wetland condition.  
- Ground-truth chemistry increased confidence in image-based estimates of wetland health.
