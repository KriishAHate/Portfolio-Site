## Overview
Following the NJDEP mapping work, I developed an **independent proposal** to examine how **marsh condition and historical ditching** influence **denitrification rates**. The goal is to place measured rates in the context of **multispectral drone indices** and site condition to understand **ecosystem functioning and service retention** across a marsh-health gradient.

## My role
- Designed the study and field sampling plan across contrasting marsh conditions.  
- Coordinated with the drone-imagery team to align sites/indices with rate measurements.  
- Managed data collection, QA, and organization for analysis.

## Tech & methods
- **Field:** Transects across ditching gradients; pore-water/soil sampling at fixed plots.  
- **Rates:** Potential denitrification assays / incubation approaches (site-appropriate).  
- **Context data:** Use of **multispectral drone products** and site notes for interpretation.

## Results
- Working hypothesis: **ditching and degraded condition reduce denitrification capacity**.  
- Outputs will link rate measurements to spectral indices and site condition.
